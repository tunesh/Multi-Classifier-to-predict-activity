Software Used

Anaconda jupyter environment was used for this project. Jupyter is a project which produces browser-based interactive 
environments for programming, mathematics, and data science. It supports a number of languages via plugins ("kernels"), 
such as Python, Ruby, Haskell, R, Scala and Julia.

Libraries Used

Pandas
In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation 
and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. 
It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.

NumPy 
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, 
along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines,
random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and
scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.

TensorFlow 
TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math
library, and also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.It is used for both research and
production at Google,? often replacing its closed-source predecessor, DistBelief.
